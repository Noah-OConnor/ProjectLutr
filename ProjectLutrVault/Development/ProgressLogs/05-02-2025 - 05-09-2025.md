## TLDR
- **Forked [Tranek's GASDocumentation](https://github.com/tranek/GASDocumentation) as project foundation**
	- Upgraded to **5.5 from 5.3**
	- Maintained ProjectLutr as the project name instead of GasDocumentation which required a lot of renaming in cpp
	- Had to **delete and rebuild all Blueprint references to GAS Attributes**, which were broken by engine changes
	- This saved time by **reusing the full C++ GAS setup** (ASC on PlayerState, AttributeSets, ability binding, etc.) without starting from scratch
- **Player Character and Input Setup**
    - Character movement fully restored post-BP deletion
    - Implemented a **modular ability slot system**:
        - Z/X/C assign abilities (Alpha, Beta, Charlie)
        - 1/2/3 activate ability in slot or assign if pending
        - Abilities currently print debug logs, but will later support loadouts and skill customization
    - Made **GA_Jump** and **GA_DoubleJump**, consuming stamina via a `JumpCost` GameplayEffect
-  **Weapon System Prototyping**
    - Created `WeaponData` (static weapon config) and `WeaponInstance` (magazine, state, etc.)
    - Built `BP_WeaponBase` Blueprint actor
        - Weapons are spawned dynamically
        - Can currently **fire on left click** (outputs debug log)`
        - Prepping for modular components (barrel, sight, mag, etc.)
-  **First-Person Gameplay Foundation**
    - Imported and set up **First-Person arms, camera, and mesh**
    - Left Third-Person model intact for multiplayer testing
    - Created a **widget crosshair**
    - Set up **projectile spawning logic**
        - Implemented both **hitscan and physics-based projectiles**
        - Currently using hitscan, but have full support for both
-  **Ammo System**
    - Added `CapacityReserve` and `MaxCapacityReserve` attributes to track **player reserve ammo**
    - Weapons hold **magazine ammo locally**, separated from GAS attributes
    - Started **Ammo UI**
        - Moved UI logic into the `PlayerController` for better separation
        - Planning to update ammo HUD dynamically using event dispatchers and `Listen for Attribute Change`
## GitHub Commits
### Initial commit
*05-02-25*
### Imported GD and Replaced some names
*05-05-25*
### Got Character Moving!
*05-06-25*
I only had to delete all of the old broken blueprints and manually rebuild the logic! This is a win tho since I won't have to rewrite all of the Boilerplate GAS setup code and work directly off of Tranek's documentation project. This will allow me to get directly into content creation and tweaking the c++ as needed rather than writing a ton of it upfront.
### Got some Gameplay Abilities Working!
*05-06-25*
GA_Jump and GA_DoubleJump are functional! 
I also deleted a bunch of the old stuff that was in here since the stats got dereferenced and will crash the project if you mess with or try to compile them.
### Debug for Ability Slot Assigning in Character
*05-07-25* 
Created several keyboard events that simulate assigning abilities to ability slots. 
Pressing Z, X, or C key will initiate assigning Test Ability Alpha, Beta, and Charlie respectively. 
Pressing 1, 2, or 3 key will activate the ability in the respective slot unless ability assigning has been initiated. In that case, it would assign the ability to that slot instead of activating it. 
Right now all these abilities do is print a debug log, but in the future this will be pivotal to character customization and gameplay.
### Starting creating modular weapon logic
*05-08-25* 
Test weapon is equipped by pressing 4 
After weapon is equipped it can be fired using left click 
Currently it only prints a log 
Created Structs for WeaponData and WeaponInstance 
Weapon data is used for initial weapon setup, holding key information about the weapon 
WeaponInstance is used to recreate existing weapons 
Created new Weapon Base Blueprint that hopefully all future weapons will be able to inherit from 
I plan on making several weapon part components that can be modularly added to modify the weapons.
### Worked on First Person Controller
*05-08-25* 
Imported First Person Assets 
Organized Folders 
Created Projectile Spawning Logic 
Setup Gameplay Ability Payload 
More Gunfire work!
### Created Projectile Logic
*05-08-25* 
Tested both physics and hitscan projectiles 
Currently have hitscan implemented, but figured out how to do both. 
Created a widget with a temp crosshair for testing 
Implemented first person camera and arms, but still left in the third person character for multiplayer testing.
### Worked on Ammo
*05-09-25* 
Added Ammo UI 
Moved HUD UI to PlayerController 
Reorganized some files 
Added CapacityReserve and MaxCapacityReserve attributes to a bunch of c++ files 
The weapon actor will handle the current ammo that each gun is using while an attribute is made to track the reserve ammo that the player has. This may be split up in the future to multiple ammo types.
