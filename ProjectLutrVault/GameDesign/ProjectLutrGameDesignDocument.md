		- Rerolled prefix will always either be the same tier or higher than the previous 
	- Spend (A currency) to attach or detach components from weapons
	- Crafting Upgrades
		- Decreased costs
		- Can craft/handle higher tier components

	- Scrapping gear will return scrap (and currency?)
	- Scrapper level will increase when scrapping things

- FFXIV Dungeon/Raid Instance Inspiration
	- Instances would have a minimum and maximum Player & Gear level
		- Players would still need to unlock the instance (By game progression and level requirement probably)
		- This would either bring players up to the minimum or down to the maximum if they’re outside of it
			- Content should become easier as the player becomes more powerful, but not too easy to be boring
	- Harder versions of the Instances exist after beating the easier version for endgame content
